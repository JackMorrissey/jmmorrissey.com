Over the years I feel like I've come across a few solid ideas. Most of them are not original, most of them aren't revolutionary, but they continue to re-emerge in slightly different variations that continually reinforce each other. Software Engineering is an entire discipline where we acknowledge at some point we are all mere script kiddies building upon the shoulders of the giants. 

I'm one of those types of people that stare up at the stars in wonderment. The little that I know about space amazes me, but more importantly, I find joy in the understanding that there is so much more to discover and to attempt to comprehend. Software isn't nearly as vast as the cosmos, but again, I understand a bit and know that will always be outweighed by the knowledge I do not have.

As I interact with teams in different companies, verticals, and backgrounds, I find that I have picked up some wisdom that is mostly universally applicable. Recently, I've found that sometimes this knowledge I've picked up ends up being valuable to others. So, I figure that's the sign that I should be chronicling my past and future adventures in software development. In the worst case scenario I'll have a place to group my thoughts, in the best case perhaps someone will learn something new.
